Welcome to my website! I'm Andrew Mizener, currently a 6th year PhD candidate in the Astronomy department at the University of Masschusetts, Amherst. My interests primarily revolve around dust in galaxies -- how it formed, how it affects observables, and how it plays a role in galaxy evolution writ large. I'm also passionate about teaching, mentoring, and observing!
