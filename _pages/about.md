Welcome to my website! I'm Andrew Mizener, currently a 6th year PhD candidate in the Astronomy department at the University of Masschusetts, Amherst. My interests primarily revolve around dust in galaxies -- how it formed, how it affects observables, and how it plays a role in galaxy evolution writ large. My current reserach uses data from large, ongoing cosmological surves (DESI and Euclid) to trace how the shape of the dust attenuation curve evolves as a function of both cosmic time and of galaxy properties like metallicity and stellar mass. I'm also passionate about teaching, mentoring, and observing!
